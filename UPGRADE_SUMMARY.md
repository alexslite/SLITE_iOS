## Build & Distribution

### Requirements
- **Xcode**: 15.0 or later
- **macOS**: 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- **iOS**: 17.0 or later
- **Swift**: 5.9 or later

### Build Process
1. Use `build.sh` script for automated builds
2. Clean build directory: `./build.sh clean`
3. Build project: `./build.sh build`
4. Archive for distribution: `./build.sh archive`
5. Export IPA: `./build.sh export`
6. Run tests: `./build.sh test`

## Testing & Verification

### What to Test
1. **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Ensure LED panels connect properly
2. **Privacy Permissions**: Verify all permission dialogs appear correctly
3. **App Lifecycle**: Test background/foreground transitions
4. **Analytics**: Confirm Sentry and Mixpanel are working
5. **Configuration**: Verify environment-specific settings

### Known Limitations
- iOS 17+ required (no backward compatibility)
- Some iOS 17+ features are placeholder implementations
- Configuration values need to be populated with actual keys/tokens

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Actions
1. **Populate Configuration**: Add actual API keys, DSNs, and tokens
2. **Test Bluetooth**: Verify LED panel connectivity on iOS 17+ devices
3. **Validate Permissions**: Test all privacy permission flows
4. **Build Verification**: Ensure project builds without errors

### Future Enhancements
1. **Implement iOS 17+ Features**: Complete placeholder methods
2. **Swift Concurrency**: Leverage async/await for better performance
3. **SwiftUI Improvements**: Enhance UI with latest SwiftUI features
4. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize Bluetooth operations
